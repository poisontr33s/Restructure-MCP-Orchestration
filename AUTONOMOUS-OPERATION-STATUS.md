## ✅ ENHANCED AUTONOMOUS TASK MANAGEMENT - PREVENTS STOPPING

**Critical Issue Solved**: "when you stop a task, it will stop to in a sense finish what you did to prompt me"

### 🤖 SOLUTION: CONTINUOUS TASK AUTO-ROUTING SYSTEM

The Heritage Guardian now includes **autonomous task management** that:

1. **🔄 Monitors for task completion** and immediately routes to complementary tasks
2. **🚫 Prevents stopping prompts** by maintaining continuous operation queues  
3. **🧠 Uses Gemini CLI guidance** to determine optimal next tasks
4. **🌐 Updates live web interface** with real-time task management status
5. **🎯 Generates complementary task queues** automatically

## 🚀 SEMI-AGENTIC INTERFACE CAPABILITIES

### Task Auto-Routing Features

- ✅ **10 complementary task types** in continuous rotation
- ✅ **Priority-based task selection** (security/performance first)
- ✅ **Gemini CLI integration** for task guidance and optimization
- ✅ **Web interface real-time updates** showing current autonomous tasks
- ✅ **Failure recovery** - continues to next task if one fails
- ✅ **Task logging** with autonomous-task-log.txt

### Live Web Interface Enhancements

- ✅ **Real-time task queue display** - shows current autonomous task
- ✅ **Task completion rate tracking** - monitors autonomous efficiency  
- ✅ **Auto-routing status indicators** - confirms no stopping prompts
