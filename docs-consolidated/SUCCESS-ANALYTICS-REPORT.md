# 🏴‍☠️ Captain Guthilda's Popup Sabotage Report

**Generated:** 08/28/2025 03:21:15  
**Repository:** C:\Users\erdno\BETTERDOWNLOADSFOLDER\github_repos2025\Restructure-MCP-Orchestration\Restructure-MCP-Orchestration

## 🎯 Identified Popup Sources

### npm Package Manager

- **Pattern:** `npm.*package.*manager`
- **Source:** VS Code npm/Node extensions
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Solution:** Configure portable Node.js environment

### Go Binary Not Found

- **Pattern:** `Failed to find the "go" binary`
- **Source:** VS Code Go Extension
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Solution:** Fix VS Code settings and PATH configuration

### GOROOT/PATH Issues

- **Pattern:** `GOROOT.*PATH.*Check PATH`
- **Source:** VS Code Go extension configuration
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Solution:** Set proper GOROOT and update VS Code settings

### TailwindCSS v4

- **Pattern:** `tailwind.*v4`
- **Source:** VS Code Tailwind CSS extension
- **Priority:** LOW
- **Solution:** Update extension settings or disable if not needed

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

1. **Update VS Code Settings** - Configure portable tool paths
2. **Set Environment Variables** - Ensure GOROOT, JAVA_HOME, etc. are set
3. **Disable Unnecessary Extensions** - Turn off extensions for unused tools
4. **Use Portable Setup Scripts** - Run setup-dev-env.ps1 before development

## 🎪 Prevention Strategy

- Always run portable environment setup before opening VS Code
- Keep dev-tools directory properly configured
- Monitor VS Code extension settings for conflicts
- Use workspace-specific settings to override global configuration
