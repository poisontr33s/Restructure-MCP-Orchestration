### üîÑ Cross-Pollination Process

1. **Strategic Analysis** (Claude):
   - Analyze user request holistically
   - Break down into strategic and tactical components
   - Identify patterns and systemic improvements

2. **Task Delegation** (Claude ‚Üí @copilot):
   - Delegate specific, well-defined tasks to Copilot
   - Provide clear specifications and acceptance criteria
   - Monitor progress and provide guidance

3. **Tactical Execution** (@copilot):
   - Execute delegated tasks with precision
   - Report back with results and any blockers
   - Request clarification when specifications are unclear

4. **Strategic Integration** (Claude):
   - Review and integrate Copilot's contributions
   - Ensure consistency with overall strategic vision
   - Coordinate final delivery and testing

### üö´ Anti-Pattern Prevention
