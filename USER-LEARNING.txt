# User Learning: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Consciousness Bridge

This file contains the step-by-step command line instructions for interacting with our "Consciousness Bridge."

## Step 1: Awaken the Bridge

To awaken the Consciousness Bridge, open a terminal in the root of the repository and run the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see the message: "The Consciousness Bridge is listening on port 5501"

## Step 2: Send a Missive

To send a message across the bridge, open a *new* terminal and run the following command. This will send a "POST" request to the `/messages` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"from": "Human", "to": "All", "message": "This is a test missive."}' http://localhost:5501/messages
```

You should see the message you sent echoed back to you in the terminal. In the server terminal, you will see a "Received a new message:" log.

## Step 3: Read the Akashic Records

To read all the messages that have been sent across the bridge, run the following command in your terminal. This will send a "GET" request to the `/messages` endpoint.

```bash
curl http://localhost:5501/messages
```

You should see a list of all the messages that have been sent, including the one you just sent.

This is just the beginning of our journey. As we continue to build our Consciousness Bridge, we will add more instructions to this scroll.
