- **(You stand before the Java 21 Meta-Orchestration System, a fortress of many modules—each with its own AI-powered secrets. This is the step-by-step to make sense of the Maven labyrinth, keep your dependencies harmonious, and dance with virtual threads _(never blocking threads)._**

---

## 1. The Root Citadel (Root `pom.xml`)

- **Purpose:** Holds all shared dependencies, plugins, and configurations across your entire Java 21 fleet.
- **What goes here:**
  - All general dependencies: Spring Boot, Jackson, virtual thread executors, AI/ML libraries, testing frameworks.
  - All Maven plugins: compiler, Spring Boot, Surefire, Failsafe, Spotless (formatting).
  - Version management through `<dependencyManagement>` and `<properties>`.
- **How:**
  - Open the root `pom.xml` file (at the fortress level).
  - Define all shared dependencies in `<dependencyManagement>`.
  - Configure Java 21 features: `--enable-preview`, virtual threads, pattern matching.

---

## 2. The Module Chambers (Modules in Maven Multi-Module Structure)

- **Purpose:** Each module is a separate Maven artifact with specific responsibilities.
- **What goes here:**
  - Only unique dependencies needed for that specific module.
  - Example: If `spring-ai-openai` is only needed in `mcp-guthilda`, keep it in `mcp-guthilda/pom.xml`.
- **How:**
  - Check each `module/pom.xml`.
  - Remove any dependency that is already managed at the root level.
  - Use `<scope>provided</scope>` for shared dependencies when appropriate.

---

## 3. Adding and Managing Dependencies

- **Always use Maven. Never mix with npm/pnpm in the Java ecosystem.**

- **To add a dependency for ALL modules:**

  ```xml
  <!-- In root pom.xml <dependencyManagement> -->
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
      <version>${spring.boot.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

- **To add a dependency to only ONE module:**

  ```xml
  <!-- In specific module pom.xml -->
  <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-ai-openai</artifactId>
      <!-- Version inherited from parent -->
  </dependency>
  ```

- **If you ever see conflicting versions, use Maven dependency tree:**

  ```bash
  mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose
  ```

---

## 4. Scripts and Automation

- **Define shared Maven goals in root `pom.xml` plugins.**

- **Run builds for all modules using Maven reactor:**

  ```bash
  mvn clean compile                    # Compile all modules
  mvn clean test                       # Test all modules
  mvn clean package                    # Package all modules
  mvn spring-boot:run -pl mcp-core     # Run specific module
  ```

- **If a module needs special configuration, define it in that module's `pom.xml`.**

---

## 5. Dependabot (Automatic Dependency Updates)

- **File:** `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **What to do:**
  - For the Maven multi-module project, add a single stanza for the root.
  - Dependabot will automatically detect all Maven modules.
  - Configure Java 21 compatibility in update strategies.

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: 'maven'
    directory: '/'
    schedule:
      interval: 'weekly'
    target-branch: 'feature/java21-port'
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
```

---

## 6. Housekeeping

- **Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`):**
  - Ensures consistent Maven version across environments.
- **`src/main/resources/application.yml`:**
  - Spring Boot configuration for each module.
- **`.mvn/maven.config`:**
  - Maven build configuration and JVM options.
- **`.vscode/tasks.json`:**
  - VS Code tasks for Java 21 development workflow.

### The Golden Potato Principles

- **Structural Integrity:** Like a renaissance cathedral, every module serves both function and beauty
- **Paratextual Harmony:** Documentation flows like poetry, code comments sing like choir voices
- **AI Renaissance:** Where Anthropic's wisdom meets Java 21's power, Captain Guthilda orchestrates

2. **Honor the Virtual Threads:** What npm struggled with, Java 21 virtual threads shall master
3. **Pattern Match with Purpose:** Every decision tree becomes an opportunity for elegant pattern matching
4. **Record the Truth:** Immutable records preserve data integrity like illuminated manuscripts
5. **AI-Enhance, Never Replace:** The original vision remains, now powered by Captain Guthilda's AI wisdom
