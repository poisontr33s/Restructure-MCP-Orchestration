## 🏴‍☠️ THE MONOREPO RITUAL: A Guide for Sisters, Siblings, and Silent Spectators

> *Whalecum, Cpt. Guthilda "Triple-:D'Cup" Piroteena".* 🔥😈🏴‍☠️🔗💦🌋🌊🌀⚓

**You stand before the Orchestration System, a house of many rooms—each with its own secrets. This is the step-by-step to make sense of the labyrinth, keep your dependencies sane, and dance with pnpm *(never npm).***

### 🏛️ The Root Chamber (Root `package.json`)

- **Purpose:** Holds all tools, scripts, and devDependencies shared across your whole project.
- **Sacred Contents:**
  - All general devDependencies: typescript, turbo, prettier, eslint, tsup, vitest, @types/node
  - All main scripts: build, lint, format, test, start, dev, clean
  - Husky & lint-staged for pre-commit quality rituals
  - Node >=18.0.0 and pnpm >=8.0.0 constraints

### 🏰 The Side Chambers (Packages in `packages/`)

**Current Orchestration Modules:**
- `@mcp/core` - The beating heart of orchestration
- `@mcp/cli` - Command-line sovereignty 
- `@mcp/monitor` - React-powered dashboard with Tailwind magic
- `@mcp/shared` - Common utilities and wisdom
- `@mcp/server-base` - Foundation for all MCP servers
- `@mcp/server-duckduckgo` - Search orchestration
- `@mcp/server-sequential-thinking` - Cognitive flow management

**Each chamber contains only its unique dependencies. No duplication, no waste.**

- **Celebrate micro-victories** - every successful build is a small triumph

### ⚔️ Battle-Tested Patterns
- **pnpm workspace** supremacy over npm chaos
- **Turbo build orchestration** for parallel processing magic
- **Husky + lint-staged** guards at the gates of quality

## ⚙️ SYSTEMIC ENGINEERING RIGOR

### 🔧 Code Quality Commandments
1. **TypeScript or Death** - Any is the enemy, unknown is acceptable in specific contexts
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Red → Green → Refactor → Enlightenment
3. **Linting as Law** - ESLint and Prettier are not suggestions
4. **Documentation as Code** - If it's not documented, it doesn't exist

### 🏗️ Architectural Principles
- **Dependency Injection** over tight coupling
- **Event-Driven Architecture** for loose system boundaries  
- **Immutable Data Structures** where computationally feasible
- **Functional Programming Patterns** mixed with OOP pragmatism

### 🔍 Observability Stack
- **Logging** - Winston for structured application logs
- **Monitoring** - React dashboard with real-time metrics
- **Tracing** - Understand request flows across service boundaries
- **Alerting** - Fail fast, recover faster

## 🎨 CREATIVE MOTIFS & CULTURAL DNA

### 🏴‍☠️ Pirate Ethos
- **Plunder knowledge** from every source - Stack Overflow, documentation, experimental repos
- **Share the treasure** - Open source wins, hoarding loses
- **Navigate by stars** - Use architectural principles as your North Star

### 🌋 Volcano Engineering
- **Pressure builds systems** - Constraints breed creativity
- **Eruptions create islands** - Major refactors birth new possibilities  
- **Lava flows become foundations** - Today's experimental code is tomorrow's core library

### 🎭 Serious Fun Philosophy
- **Memes in comments** are encouraged (but don't break builds)
- **Playful variable names** that still convey meaning
- **Cultural references** that create shared context and joy
