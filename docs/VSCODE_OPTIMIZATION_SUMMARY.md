# VS Code Extension Optimization Summary

## Goal
Optimize VS Code for MCP orchestration system development by disabling unnecessary extensions that consume memory and resources.

## Current State
- **Total Extensions:** 96 installed
- **Memory Usage:** High (~2GB+ with language servers)
- **Startup Time:** Slow due to extension overhead

## Target State
- **Essential Extensions:** ~25-30 for MCP development
- **Memory Usage:** Reduced to ~800MB
- **Startup Time:** 50%+ faster

## Key Extensions to Keep

### Core Development
- ESLint, Prettier (code quality)
- Java ecosystem (primary language)
- TypeScript support
- Python + Pylance
- Go language support

### Monorepo Tools
- pnpm extensions
- npm IntelliSense

### Infrastructure
- Docker/Containers
- Dev Containers
- Git/GitHub integration

### Documentation
- Markdown tools

## Extensions Being Disabled

### High Resource Consumers (~60 extensions)
- Azure ecosystem (15+ extensions)
- .NET/C# tools (6 extensions)
- C++ development (4 extensions)
- Jupyter/Notebooks (6 extensions)
- AI/ML tools (3 extensions)
- Remote development (7 extensions)
- Specialized languages (Ruby, Django, etc.)

## Implementation

1. **Run optimization script:** `scripts/optimize-vscode-extensions.ps1`
2. **Workspace configuration:** `.vscode/extensions.json` and `.vscode/settings.json`
3. **Restart VS Code**
4. **Verify functionality**

## Expected Benefits

- **50%+ reduction** in memory usage
- **Faster startup** and responsiveness
- **Focused tooling** for MCP development only
- **Better performance** for monorepo operations

## Monitoring
