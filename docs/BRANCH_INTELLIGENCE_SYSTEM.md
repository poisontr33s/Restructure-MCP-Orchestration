# Branch Intelligence System - Advanced Branch Management & Chaos Prevention

The Branch Intelligence System provides sophisticated cross-repository branch analysis, deviation detection, PR/Issue correlation, and automated escalation to prevent "branches gone wild" scenarios.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### 1. **Branch Complexity Analysis**

- **Deviation Detection**: Measures how far branches have diverged from the main branch
- **Complexity Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring based on commits, files changed, age, and correlations
- **Progression Tracking**: Analyzes branch development patterns and progression over time
- **Cross-Comparison**: Compares branches against base branches to understand development flow

### 2. **PR/Issue Correlation Intelligence**

- **Automatic Correlation**: Links branches to related Pull Requests and Issues
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies branch naming patterns that indicate issue relationships
- **Workflow Integration**: Tracks branch lifecycle through PR creation and resolution
- **Orphan Detection**: Identifies branches without associated PRs or Issues

### 3. **Chaos Prevention & Detection**

- **"Branches Gone Wild" Detection**: Identifies branches that have exceeded complexity thresholds
- **Escalation Triggers**: Automatically flags branches requiring immediate attention
- **Chaos Scoring**: Provides chaos metrics for repository health assessment
- **Prevention Measures**: Suggests actions to prevent chaotic branch scenarios

### 4. **Cross-Repository Intelligence**

- **Organization-Wide Analysis**: Analyzes branches across all repositories from central location
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies common patterns and anti-patterns across repositories
- **Best Practice Identification**: Suggests improvements based on successful patterns
- **Unified Reporting**: Provides consolidated view of branch health across all projects

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Immediate Analysis

```bash
# Analyze all branches across all repositories
npm run branch-intelligence:analyze

# Generate comprehensive markdown report
npm run branch-intelligence:report

# Check for chaos scenarios
npm run branch-intelligence:chaos-check

# Get JSON output for automation
npm run branch-intelligence:json
```

### GitHub Actions (Automated Intelligence)

The system runs automatically with multiple triggers:

- **Daily Analysis**: Every day at 6 AM UTC for proactive monitoring
- **PR Analysis**: Automatically analyzes branch complexity on PR creation
- **Manual Triggers**: On-demand analysis through GitHub Actions interface
