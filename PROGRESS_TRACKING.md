## 🔍 Analysis Results

### Repository Health Score: 85/100
- **Strengths:**
  - Well-structured monorepo with clear package separation
  - Modern tooling (pnpm, turbo, TypeScript, Vite)
  - Comprehensive automation with Captain Guthilda
  - Already migrated to GitHub Actions v4 artifacts
  - Good security practices with proper secrets management

- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Some workflows lack consistent error handling
  - pnpm enforcement could be stricter in certain workflows
  - Cache optimization opportunities exist
  - Documentation could be more comprehensive

### Workflow Analysis Summary
- **Total Workflows:** 34 files
- **Already v4 Compatible:** ✅ Confirmed
- **pnpm Usage:** Mostly consistent, some npm fallbacks to address
- **Security Compliance:** Good, but can be enhanced
- **Performance:** Room for optimization

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Notes

### Fixed Issues
1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility**
   ```diff
   - @apply w-3 h-3 rounded-full inline-block mr-2;
   + width: 0.75rem; height: 0.75rem; border-radius: 50%; 
   + display: inline-block; margin-right: 0.5rem;
   ```

2. **Build Pipeline**
   - All packages now use consistent build patterns
   - Turbo cache working efficiently
   - TypeScript compilation successful across all packages

### Workflow Patterns Identified
- Matrix job patterns for package building
- Artifact upload/download with unique naming
- Scheduled automation (Captain Guthilda, branch management)
- Cross-repository operations support
