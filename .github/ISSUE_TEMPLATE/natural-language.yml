        Once you submit your story, our AI collaboration team will respond:
        
        - **@claude** will provide strategic analysis and comprehensive guidance
        - **@copilot** may assist with tactical implementation details
        - **Human team members** will join for additional perspective when needed
        
        We'll work together using natural language, creative problem-solving, and 
        renaissance-level attention to detail to help you achieve your goals.
        
        **Remember**: This is a conversation, not a form! Feel free to be creative, 
        detailed, and authentic in sharing your thoughts.
