# 🏗️ Repository Structure & Issue Resolution Plan

## 🎯 Current Reality Check

Based on actual evidence from screenshots and terminal output:

### ❌ **Immediate Issues**
1. **VS Code Workspace Crashed** - go.mod creation broke the workspace
2. **Go Extension Confusion** - Points to Win11 system instead of project Go
3. **Mixed Environments** - Multiple conflicting Go setups
4. **No Clear Structure** - Repository lacks organized workflow

### ✅ **What Actually Works**
- **MCP v2 Infrastructure**: Core packages are functional
- **Hardware Detection**: Real Windows APIs work
- **Basic Repository**: Files exist and are accessible

## 🏗️ Proposed Repository Structure

## 🔧 Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Stop Breaking Things
1. **Remove problematic go.mod** from root (if it exists)
2. **Reset VS Code workspace** to working state
3. **Document current working state** before making changes
4. **Create backup** of current configuration

### Phase 2: Fix Go Extension Issues
1. **Identify correct Go installation** for this project
2. **Configure VS Code Go extension** to use project-specific Go
3. **Set proper GOPATH/GOROOT** for workspace
4. **Install required Go tools** in correct location

### Phase 3: Establish Clear Structure
1. **Create clear documentation** for setup process
2. **Separate concerns** (MCP, Go, Docker, etc.)
3. **Define development workflow** that actually works
4. **Test each component** independently

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing
1. **Create validation scripts** that test real functionality
2. **Benchmark actual performance** (not assumptions)
3. **Document what works** vs. what doesn't
4. **Provide clear troubleshooting** steps

## 🚫 What We WON'T Do

- ❌ Make assumptions about what works
- ❌ Create "optimizations" without benchmarks
- ❌ Modify system-level configurations
- ❌ Add complexity without clear benefit
- ❌ Create files that break existing functionality

## ✅ What We WILL Do

- ✅ Fix one issue at a time
- ✅ Test each change before proceeding
- ✅ Document actual results (not assumptions)
- ✅ Provide rollback instructions
- ✅ Focus on real, measurable improvements

## 🎯 Success Metrics

1. **VS Code workspace loads without crashes**
2. **Go extension works with correct environment**
3. **MCP packages build and test successfully**
4. **Clear documentation for setup/development**
5. **Reproducible development environment**

## 🔄 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Assess current damage** - What's broken from recent changes?
2. **Restore working state** - Get back to a stable baseline
3. **Document working configuration** - Before making more changes
4. **Fix Go extension** - One specific, testable issue
5. **Validate fix** - Ensure it actually works

---

**Priority: Get back to a working state, then improve incrementally with validation.**
