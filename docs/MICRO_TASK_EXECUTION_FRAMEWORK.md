```bash
# Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel execution where possible)
./execute-micro-task.sh DEP-REACT-CONSOLIDATION
./execute-micro-task.sh DEP-UI-UNIFICATION      # Can run parallel with above
./execute-micro-task.sh DEP-TYPESCRIPT-ALIGNMENT # Must run after React consolidation

# Phase 2: Infrastructure (Sequential execution required)  
./execute-micro-task.sh INFRA-ACTIONS-V4
./execute-micro-task.sh BRIDGE-CROSS-REPO-ACTIVATION

# Phase 3: Advanced Features (Can be deployed incrementally)
./execute-micro-task.sh ORG-BRANCH-MANAGEMENT
./execute-micro-task.sh META-AUTO-INTELLIGENCE
```

1. **Pre-Execution Validation:** Dependency checks, resource availability
2. **Execution Monitoring:** Real-time progress tracking, error detection  
3. **Post-Execution Verification:** Functionality testing, integration validation
4. **Rollback Readiness:** Automated rollback capability verification
