# Workflow Archive

This directory contains archived workflow configurations and deprecated templates that have been preserved for reference and potential future repurposing based on ML insights and structural integrity assessments.

## Archive Organization

- `workflows/` - Previous workflow configurations
- `templates/` - Deprecated YAML templates
- `proposals/` - Workflow improvement proposals
- `iterations/` - Multiple versions for comparison and evolution

## Archive Philosophy

Following @poisontr33s' guidance: Instead of deletion, we preserve, analyze, and iterate based on value assessment and structural integrity. Each archived item includes:

- Original purpose and context
- Reason for archival
- Potential repurposing opportunities
- ML-based insights for future iterations
