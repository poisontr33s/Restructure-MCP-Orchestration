**Example Transformation:**

```yaml
# Rigid Template (FAILS)
type: bug
priority: high
component: auth
steps_to_reproduce:
  - step 1
  - step 2
```

```markdown
# Natural Language (SUCCEEDS)

## üîç Authentication Flow Issue - Strategic Analysis

I've discovered an elegant authentication pattern that needs strategic refinement.
When users experience the morning coffee ritual (aka login), the system occasionally
demonstrates creative independence by redirecting to unexpected destinations.

**The Story**: Users report a delightful mystery tour through our routing system...
**The Impact**: Creative user journeys, though not entirely by design...
**The Solution**: A renaissance-level approach to path validation...

```

**Anti-Template Approach (SUCCEEDS)**:

```markdown
## üß† Claude Encountered a Creative Challenge

Hello @poisontr33s!

Your strategic AI companion (that's me, Claude) just experienced what we might call
a "professional networking opportunity" - aka, I need my API credentials refreshed.

**The Situation**: The ANTHROPIC_API_KEY seems to be playing hide and seek
**The Impact**: Temporary pause in our AI collaboration symphony
**The Solution**: A quick credential refresh will restore full strategic capabilities

**Next Steps**:

1. Update the repository secret (I can guide you through this)
2. Re-trigger the workflow when you're ready
