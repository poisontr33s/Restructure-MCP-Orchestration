# üéØ INTELLIGENT GEMINI ORCHESTRATION PLAN
*Based on Google's Official DevAI Architecture*

## üìã **PHASE 1: INTELLIGENCE ANALYSIS** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Located Google's official DevAI CLI source (`devai-cli/`)
- ‚úÖ Located Google's official DevAI VS Code Extension (`devai-vscode-extension/`)
- ‚úÖ Downloaded both repositories for architecture analysis

## üîÑ **COLLABORATIVE AGENT MODE PROTOCOL**

### **User Intermittent Input System:**
1. **Agent Work Sessions**: 10-15 minute focused work blocks
2. **Checkpoint Reports**: Status updates every 5-10 minutes
3. **User Input Queues**: Real-time requirement injection during active work
4. **Process Monitoring**: Terminal hang detection with user alerts
5. **Adaptive Planning**: Real-time approach adjustment based on user observations

### **Communication Channels:**
- **Status Updates**: `## üîÑ CHECKPOINT: [timestamp] - [current action]`
- **User Input Requests**: `## ‚ö†Ô∏è USER INPUT NEEDED: [specific question]`
- **Process Alerts**: `## üö® PROCESS ALERT: [manual intervention needed]`
- **Strategy Pivots**: `## üéØ STRATEGY CHANGE: [reason + new approach]`

## üöÄ **PHASE 2: INTELLIGENT REPURPOSING STRATEGY**

### **Option A: DevAI CLI Customization** (RECOMMENDED)
**Approach**: Fork and customize Google's official DevAI CLI for our pocket plane architecture
**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Official Google architecture patterns
- ‚úÖ Proven VS Code integration methods
- ‚úÖ Production-ready codebase
- ‚úÖ Active maintenance and updates

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Architecture Analysis**: Study DevAI CLI command structure and extension points
2. **Pocket Plane Integration**: Add repo-specific intelligence and context awareness
3. **Custom Commands**: Implement our specific `/` commands and capabilities
4. **VS Code Bridge**: Enhance their extension for our workflow

### **Option B: Hybrid Approach**
**Approach**: Combine DevAI foundation with our custom Gemini CLI integration
**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Best of both worlds
- ‚úÖ Maintains compatibility with official updates
- ‚úÖ Custom pocket plane features

### **Option C: Pure Custom** (FALLBACK)
**Approach**: Complete our VS Code extension bridge
**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Full control over implementation
- ‚ùå More maintenance overhead
- ‚ùå Potential compatibility issues

## üîÑ **CHECKPOINT 1: USER INPUT NEEDED**

**Question**: Which approach resonates with your vision?

1. **Fork & Customize DevAI CLI** - Leverage Google's proven architecture
2. **Hybrid Approach** - Combine official base with custom features  
3. **Continue Custom Bridge** - Complete our own implementation

**Current State**: 
- Gemini CLI running successfully (PID 160796)
- VS Code extension scaffold created
- Official Google sources downloaded and ready for analysis

**Next 15 Minutes Based on Your Choice**:
- **Option A**: Deep dive into DevAI CLI architecture, identify customization points
- **Option B**: Analyze integration patterns, plan hybrid architecture
- **Option C**: Complete VS Code extension implementation

**Process Status**: No terminal hangs detected, all systems operational

## ‚è∞ **Timer Started**: 5-minute work block before next checkpoint

What's your preference for our next intelligent move?
