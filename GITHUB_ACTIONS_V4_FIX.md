# GitHub Actions v4 Artifact Compatibility and pnpm Configuration Fix

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Identified:
1. **Mixed Package Manager Configuration**: CI workflow using `cache: 'npm'` but trying to execute `pnpm` commands
2. **Missing pnpm Setup**: Jobs attempting to use pnpm without proper installation
3. **GitHub Actions v3 to v4 Migration**: Some workflows still using deprecated artifact@v3 actions
4. **Inconsistent Dependency Installation**: Some jobs using `npm ci` others using `pnpm install`

### Error Patterns:
- "Unable to locate executable file: pnpm"
- "Dependencies lock file is not found...Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock"
- Artifact upload/download failures due to v3/v4 compatibility issues

## Micro-Task Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed CI Workflow Configuration (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **Added proper pnpm setup** using `pnpm/action-setup@v4`
- **Updated Node.js cache** from `'npm'` to `'pnpm'`
- **Standardized dependency installation** to `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
- **Maintained GitHub Actions v4 artifact compatibility** with unique artifact names

### 2. Updated Cross-Repository Bridge Workflow (.github/workflows/cross-repo-bridge.yml)
- **Fixed pnpm installation order** (setup pnpm before Node.js setup)
- **Updated artifact action** from v3 to v4 with proper configuration
- **Added unique artifact naming** to prevent conflicts
- **Enhanced error handling** with `if-no-files-found: warn`

### 3. Key Configuration Changes Made:

#### Before (Broken):
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
    cache: 'npm'
    
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
  
- name: Build package
  run: pnpm run build  # ERROR: pnpm not available
```

#### After (Fixed):
```yaml
- name: Install pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
  with:
    version: 8
    
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: ${{ env.NODE_VERSION }}
    cache: 'pnpm'
    
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
  
- name: Build package
  run: pnpm run build
```

## GitHub Actions v4 Artifact Compatibility

### Key v4 Changes Addressed:
1. **Unique Artifact Names**: All artifacts now include `${{ github.sha }}` to ensure uniqueness
2. **Immutable Artifacts**: v4 artifacts cannot be overwritten, resolved with unique naming
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added `if-no-files-found` parameter for better error management
4. **Matrix Job Compatibility**: Each matrix job produces distinctly named artifacts

### Example v4 Compatible Artifact Usage:
```yaml
- name: Upload build artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-artifacts-${{ matrix.package }}-${{ github.sha }}
    path: packages/${{ matrix.package }}/dist/
    retention-days: 7
    if-no-files-found: error
```

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Check pnpm availability**:
   ```bash
   pnpm --version  # Should return version 8.x
   ```

2. **Verify lockfile recognition**:
   ```bash
   ls -la pnpm-lock.yaml  # Should exist and be recognized
   ```

3. **Test build process**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   pnpm run build
   ```

4. **Validate workflow syntax**:
   ```bash
   # GitHub CLI or Actions tab should show no syntax errors
   ```

## Repository Configuration Confirmed

The repository is correctly configured as a pnpm monorepo:
- ✅ `package.json` specifies `"packageManager": "pnpm@8.15.0"`
- ✅ `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defines workspace structure
- ✅ `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists with dependency lock information
- ✅ All package scripts use pnpm commands

## Impact of Fixes

### Before:
- ❌ CI builds failing due to package manager mismatch
- ❌ Artifact upload/download failures
- ❌ Inconsistent dependency installation
- ❌ Multiple scanners reporting v3/v4 compatibility issues

### After:
- ✅ Consistent pnpm usage across all workflows
- ✅ GitHub Actions v4 artifact compatibility
- ✅ Proper dependency caching and installation
- ✅ Unique artifact naming prevents conflicts
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Test the updated workflows** on next push/PR
2. **Monitor build logs** for successful pnpm installation
3. **Verify artifact upload/download** functionality
4. **Check scanner reports** for resolved v3/v4 issues

This comprehensive fix addresses the root causes of both the package manager configuration issues and GitHub Actions v4 compatibility problems that were causing widespread CI failures across the repository.
