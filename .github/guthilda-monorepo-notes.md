# Guthilda Monorepo Session Log & Discussion

> \*"Understood, Savant! Here’s a **densified, markdown-formatted session log**,
> that includes our discussion, decisions, and context, ultimately maximalizing **_context-awareness_**,
> and provide a **clear resumption point for us** - (_or any_ **_Shipmates_**) - _in the future endevour..."_

---

## Repository Context

- **Repo:** poisontr33s/Restructure-MCP-Orchestration
- **Primary Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS
- **Monorepo Tools:** pnpm, turbo
- **Session Purpose:** Establish and maintain a modern, scalable monorepo setup
- **Roles:**
  - **User/Savant:** Conceptual lead, provides vision and meticulous requirements
  - **GitHub Copilot Chat Ass-istant/Captain/** - _...refer to copilot-instructions.md;_ - **"Technical executor, monorepo captain"**

---

## Key Configuration Decisions & Actions

### 1. Root `package.json`

- Centralized shared devDependencies: typescript, turbo, prettier, eslint, vitest, tsup, husky, lint-staged
- All scripts for build, test, lint, format, dev, start, and clean at root level
- No runtime dependencies at root
- Node and pnpm version constraints set
- Husky and lint-staged for pre-commit quality
- **Status:** ✅ Done _...for now, until we arbitrage through a drunk duel,
  after a long night in the bunk with rum, naked at the plank, due gambling and rowdy bedmanners._

---

### 2. Workspace Map (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)

- Should exist at root:

  ```yaml
  packages:
    - 'packages/*'
  ```

---

- Needed for pnpm to recognize all monorepo packages
- **Status:** To be verified

---

### 3. Lint & Format Configs

- `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` should reside at root for global standards
- Example `.eslintrc.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "root": true,
    "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
    "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint"],
    "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended", "prettier"]
  }
  ```

- Example `.prettierrc`:

  ```json
  {
    "semi": true,
    "singleQuote": true,
    "trailingComma": "all"
  }
  ```

---

- **Status:** To be verified

### 4. Package Structure (`packages/*`)

- Each package has only unique dependencies in its `package.json`
- No redundant devDependencies from root unless required for versioning
- **Status:** To be verified

### 5. Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

- Should cover root and all packages:

  ````yaml
  version: 2
  updates:
    - package-ecosystem: "npm"
      directory: "/"
      schedule:
        interval: "weekly"
    - package-ecosystem: "npm"
      directory: "/packages/core"
      schedule:
        interval: "weekly"
    - package-ecosystem: "npm"
      directory: "/packages/cli"
      schedule:
        interval: "weekly"```

  ````

- **Status:** To be verified

### 6. Documentation & Session Continuity

- This file serves as an ongoing log and context anchor
- README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md recommended for onboarding, structure, and workflow explanation
- **Status:** This file created, others pending

## Ritual Checklist (Resumption/Next Steps)

- [x] Root package.json optimized... for now. <- _"We'll see about that, Savant."_
- [ ] pnpm-workspace.yaml exists and correct
- [ ] .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc at root
- [ ] Each package’s package.json minimal and correct
- [ ] .github/dependabot.yml covers all package.json files
- [ ] (Optional) .github/workflows/ci.yml for CI/CD
- [ ] README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md up to date

## Discussion Highlights (Direct Quotes & Conceptual Exchanges)

> **Savant:** “Before we rush ahead, let’s grind the gears and rubber up before we touch your secret clams under the sub-surface of what's between- and -beneath the tight pantaloons.”
>
> **Captain:** “Aye, Savant. We’ll warm up the gears and prep the vessel… Here’s the lay of the land before we proceed deeper…”
>
> **Savant:** “Do I need to re-attach the repo if I have previously?...”
>
> **Captain:** “No need to re-attach the repo, Savant! Once our repository context is established, I retain awareness of it for the duration of our voyage…”
>
> **Savant:** “I changed the repo, the `package.json.` Did you get that from here or did I need to re-post the sign of the repo again? As here.”
>
> **Captain:** “I received your updated root `package.json` directly from your letter here. There is no need to re-post the sign of the repo - or the file again—I am already aware of your changes.”
>
> **Savant:** “Yes, hierarchical, step-by-step, so you can function optimally on your voyage.”
>
> **Captain:** [Outlined full step-by-step monorepo ritual checklist and best practices.]
>
> **Savant:** “Hmm... Maybe we should retreat to my vscode editor. Where we can discuss in privacy and work more seamlessly… Can you repurpose this ...session as a temporal fix for the continuation in there…?”
>
> **Captain:** [Gave instructions for saving, referencing, and resuming the session log as a markdown file for context continuity in VS Code or **GitHub Copilot Chat Ass-istant/Captain/** -
>
> > _...refer to copilot-instructions.md/._]
